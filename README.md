This simple Python3 script aims to download locus tags from a txt file in a list 

## Usage

```bash
python3 locus_tags_fetcher.py -i list_locus_tags.txt -db protein  
```
As dependencies, you need to have Biopython and argparse (get them via pip3 or conda)

You will get one file with all the locus tags in one FASTA file.
